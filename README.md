# Python_pet_projects
Small personal projects for fun, learning and improving new skills in Python programming.

* [1: Fitness Tracker Module](https://github.com/AMRedichkina/Python_pet_projects/tree/main/Fitness_tracker_module)
It is a tool to track fitness goals and monitor progress. The user can set goals, track workouts and monitor their progress over time. The project utilizes algorithms and libraries to track and store fitness data in an organized manner, making it easy for users to access and review their progress.  
  
* [2: Hangman game](https://github.com/AMRedichkina/Python_pet_projects/tree/main/Hangman)
The "Hangman" project in the "Python_pet_projects" repository is a classic word guessing game where the player has to guess the word one letter at a time. If the player fails to guess the word correctly within a certain number of attempts, the hangman graphic is displayed. The game is implemented using Python and is a great way to learn the basics of game development and building user interfaces in Python.  
   
* [3: Homework bot](https://github.com/AMRedichkina/Python_pet_projects/tree/main/Homework_bot)
The project that uses the Telegram API which aims to automate the process of completing and submitting homework assignments. The project uses the functionality of a bot to assist with homework-related tasks, making the process more efficient and streamlined.  
  
* [4: Kitty bot](https://github.com/AMRedichkina/Python_pet_projects/tree/main/Kitty_bot)
A Python project that uses the Telegram API. It is likely a bot that interacts with users on the Telegram platform and is designed to perform some specific tasks related to cats or other related topics. The exact functionality of the bot is not clear without further information.  
  
* [5: The_Caesar_cipher](https://github.com/AMRedichkina/Python_pet_projects/tree/main/The_Caesar_cipher)
a program that implements the Caesar cipher, which is a simple method of encryption that shifts the letters in a message by a certain number of places. The program takes a plaintext message and a key as input, and returns the encrypted message.  
  
* [6: ToDo App](https://github.com/AMRedichkina/Python_pet_projects/tree/main/ToDoApp) 
A project is a Tkinter-based GUI application for managing tasks and to-do lists.
  
* [7: ToDo App Website](https://github.com/AMRedichkina/Python_pet_projects/tree/main/To_do_app_site) 
The user interface is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend is implemented in Python with the Django framework. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, and it can store the data in a database for persistent storage.  
  
* [8: Weather app](https://github.com/AMRedichkina/Python_pet_projects/tree/main/Weather_app)
This project creates a weather app that shows the current weather conditions and forecast for a specific location
